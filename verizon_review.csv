22,Samsung Galaxy S7,I'm very happy that I decided not to buy an iPhone 7.,"After I bought a Vizio e-series tv, I decided to upgrade my phone, as the Vizio uses apps on the cellphone to control streaming online content. Not only do the two devices function seamlessly together, but compared to my old Samsung Galaxy s3, the s7 is beautiful (the gold-on-platinum finish is so striking, I bought a transparent phone case for it), light, fast, incredibly user-friendly, charges rapidly (less than an hour), and holds a charge throughout a long, busy day. The screen is big without being too big, and for an added bonus, the earbuds included with the phone sound much better than you'd expect, particularly when paired with the Poweramp music player app available on the Google Play Store.","Feb 08, 2017",billybangdouglas

40,Samsung Galaxy S7,Fantastic leap from S4,"After spending two comfortable years with the S4, I was apprehensive of having to start all over with a new phone. Enter a wonderful Verizon Rep at the local store who answered all my questions and was there for me when I needed help with a few of the newer bells and whistles. I am one week into the new ownership and am loving it. It's fast, durable, and fun to work with. I love the ease of moving apps from page to page","Jan 28, 2017",vhill1953

45,Samsung Galaxy S7,Love the phone! Hate the battery life!,"I went back to the Galaxy S series after a few years with the Motorola Droid. I am completely satisified with everything the phone has to offer except the battery life. I have to charge it atleast twice a day. Thank goodness for the rapid charge feature. I really don't feel like I use it as much as others but the battery drains really fast. I'm not a big app user. My biggest use is on facebook while looking at pics. However, even being idle at night, it rapidly drains. I've turned off most of my notifications. too. Anyway, the size is perfect for me - not too big, not too small. It's got everything I need and more.","Jan 26, 2017",ReneeN
46,Samsung Galaxy S7,great phone...easy to navigate...this is the phone I should have had all al,the product is great...I like the features...and something I have not seen in a while was my being to transfer my information from my old phone...I was very impressed with that feature.

51,Samsung Galaxy S7,Best phone yet.,"I'm a late bloomer to the smart phones. The Samsung Galaxy S7 IS my second Android. I find it very easy to use. The APPS are similar to my HTC one, but only a million times faster. The pictures are incredible.","Jan 24, 2017",Top Cop

56,Samsung Galaxy S7,"Loved my Windows phone, but this is a great replacement!","I was a huge fan of the Nokia Lumia line of phones, but Verizon stopped carrying the upgrades for this line, and the selection of Windows apps was dismal. Switching to this phone has been great - there are an indefinite number of apps for Google Play, it's user-friendly, and it has some great capabilities with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. While I feel that my Nokia Lumia took better nighttime photos, I am overall happy with this phone's camera and the ease with which I can turn data, wifi and location on and off and the ""power save"" mode, all which help save on battery life. There is very little that I miss from my old phone - mostly a couple of games specific to Windows/Xbox. Every app I had on that phone, there are at least 5 similar offerings on Google Play. Also love that it isn't too large for my small girl-hands to hold.","Jan 22, 2017",krystlechc

58,Samsung Galaxy S7,Easier than iPhone,I'll admit that I'm not very tech savvy and my prior phone (iPhone) really made me feel dumb. I was always bugging anyone I knew that had one with so many questions. I counted down the days until I was eligible for an upgrade. My son and sister both have Samsung phones and had told me on numerous occasions that I would be much happier with one. I now have the Samsung GalaxyS7 and I love it. It's only been a week but I feel like I already have mastered so much more on this phone than the other one I had for years.,"Jan 21, 2017",Cherry8

77,Samsung Galaxy S7,Transitioning from the iOS to the Samsung Galaxy s7 was much easier than I initially expected it to be.,"This is an amazing phone. First and foremost I love the customizability of it. It's quite literally a personal companion down to the nitty gritty. Transferring information from the iOS was easy too. Unlike iTunes, Samsung is made to be a compatible devise per each individual user. I love this phone. Obviously being waterproof is an outstanding perk. I used to think the battery life of the iOS was something to be proud of, but the galaxy s7 has a tremendous battery life and charges 100% faster. That helps so you don't go to bed with your phone plugged in and when it's done charging it doesn't just continually burn up the battery. You charge it as its needed and that's that. So far I have yet to find anything I dislike about the Samsung Galaxy s7. Highly recommend this phone.","Jan 14, 2017",GoGalaxybyBeefy

80,Samsung Galaxy S7,Easy transition form the iPhone 6s,"I have had my Galaxy S7 for less then a week now, and I have to admit - for the first 2 or 3 days I was pretty hesitant about keeping it. However, I am now sold on the phone. It can do so much more then my previous iPhone 6s and it has a lot more power behind it. The switch over, which I thought was going to be very difficult, was actually pretty simple, and I was able to do it compleatly from home. Yes, even switching over my contacts!","Jan 13, 2017",IntrepidSky

82,Samsung Galaxy S7,I Love My Phone!,"I got my phone a couple of months ago after upgrading from the Galaxy S5 and have no problems with it. I can go a whole day without charging until night time and then there are days I do have to charge during the day. It all depends on how I use my phone. I have a lot of apps that was transferred from the Galaxy S5 but haven't activate all of them. If I had activated all of them, then I would be charging my phone twice or more a day. BTW I like the new style charger because the the hardly feels hot to the touch. I do have minor complaints. 1- Not happy with a removable battery. It was the only I could shut off my other phones when they froze. This phone hasn't frozen so far. 2- Being made of glass. More of a risk of being cracked. That was one of the reasons why I didn't want the iPhone. 3- Needs sensitivity touch control when wearing gloves in the winter which they had on the Galaxy S5. 4- Needs voice commands when using a Bluetooth when driving. I had that command when I had a flip phone (I forgot which cell phone company had that. All I had to do was press the button on my Bluetooth and the voice commands came on.) so why can't a smart phone have it without going to the PlayStore and downloading Google Voice? It should be automatically programmed into the phone just like my old flip phone? Otherwise, I am very happy with the phone. It is very easy to use and Verizonwireless customer service is very helpful when I am in a jam.","Jan 12, 2017",beedee11126
